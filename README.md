## MongoDB
NoSQL database that stores data in the form of documents rather than tables, making it more flexible and scalable than traditional SQL-based relational databases. Unlike relational databases that use rows and columns, MongoDB organizes data into collections of documents that use BSON (Binary JSON) format.

### Key Characteristics of MongoDB:

Schema-less: No predefined structure, allowing for more flexibility.

Scalable: Can handle large amounts of data efficiently.

High Performance: Optimized for fast reads and writes.

Distributed System: Supports replication and horizontal scaling.
